Business objective:
An employer from a company that focuses on low-sugar products has developed a new sweetener and wants to determine which product category possesses the most consumer demand for natural sweeteners. Hence, they know which business would be their ideal customer.  They want you to find a dataset containing information on consumer purchases and use that dataset to determine which food product category has the most demand to produce items low in sugar.

Data used:
The dataset contains data points about consumer purchases of online grocery store items from Instacart. It is divided into six csv files organized in the form of rows and columns. These files include:

1.Product.csv
2.Aisle.csv
3.Department.csv
4.Orders.csv

Before being processed, the product dataset was uploaded onto Excel, and its contents were filtered to only include items that fall in sweetened goods categories. This was done by first filtering the aisle column and formatting the other columns to organize themselves concerning the filter.

Conclusion:
The results of the analysis as indicated by the graph show that the most popular sweetened goods that consumers purchase pertain to the ice cream and frozen desserts category followed by juice, candy,  baked sweets, and soft drinks.

My recommendations:
1. The manufacturer as a result should focus on developing their business by first selling their product to popular and innovative ice cream brands and observe if they can generate a sizable revenue and profit from such a transaction before moving their efforts onto the second most popular, the third and so on.

2. The manufacturer should also expect the summer, fall, and winter seasons to be their most profitable as the weather and seasonal holidays drive ice cream, juice, and candy (The top three products that are in most demand by consumers). As a result, they should direct most of their marketing and inventory storage efforts to consumers and businesses during these times.
